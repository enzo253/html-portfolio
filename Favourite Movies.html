    <h1> My Favoutite Movies </h1>
    <hr>
    <h2> Three of my all time favourites </h2>
    <h3> Porco Rosso </h3>
    <p>Porco Rosso explores themes of freedom, identity, and the human spirit in a profound way. Marco Pagot, turned
        into a pig and known as Porco Rosso, chooses this form to reject a corrupt society. His famous line, "I'd rather
        be a pig than a fascist," reflects his disdain for the political turmoil of his time and his quest for true
        freedom. Despite his appearance, Porco embodies honor, bravery, and empathy. The stunning animation and
        evocative music made a lasting impression on me. "Porco Rosso" is a reflection on the complexities of identity
        and freedom that I won't soon forget.</p>

    <h3> La La Land </h3>
    <p> La La Land is truly exceptional, blending musical, romance, and drama in a way that feels both nostalgic and
        fresh. The stunning visuals and unforgettable soundtrack, along with the incredible performances by Emma Stone
        and Ryan Gosling, create an immersive experience. It masterfully balances a tribute to classic Hollywood
        musicals with a modern exploration of dreams, love, and sacrifice. The innovative choreography and emotional
        depth left me captivated. </p>

    <h3> Sherlock Holmes</h3>
    <p> Sherlock Holmes A Game of Shadows is a thrilling ride that builds on its predecessor with even more intensity
        and intrigue. The dynamic between Robert Downey Jr. and Jude Law adds depth to the iconic characters, bringing
        Sherlock Holmes and Dr. Watson to life in a fresh and exciting way. The clever plot twists, high-stakes action
        scenes, and intricate puzzles make it a gripping watch from start to finish. The film’s stylish direction and
        sharp dialogue keep you on the edge of your seat, while the antagonist’s stellar performance adds an extra layer
        of tension and excitement. Really just a lot of fun and my all-time classic feel-good movie.</p>
