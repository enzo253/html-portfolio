    <h1> About Me </h1>
    <hr>
    <h3> I hail from Australia, a quaint little town that likely speaks volumes about my easygoing nature. I'm rather
        relaxed, enjoying a great many things and disliking very few. When it comes to my skills, I'm an aspiring full
        stack developer with a penchant for data science. My naturally curious nature fuels my passion for programming.
        On my projects page, you'll find both my data science endeavors and full stack projects, each reflecting my
        dedication to excellence. I'm always striving to improve and thoroughly enjoy the journey of constant learning
        and growth. </h3>
